# What is this?
A tool to randomly pre-assign Zoom call participants to breakout rooms, with sessions rotating 4 times, e.g., on a 60 minute call there would be 4 sessions, each lasting 15 minutes.

This requires a minimum of 7 participants, the preferred breakout size is 4, but there may be rooms with 3 or 5 participants if the number of attendees is not evenly divisible by 4.  

For example, 9 participants will be allocated to 2 breakout rooms of 4 and 5, rather than 3 rooms with 3 participants each. 

These constraints are currently hard coded, but can be easily tweaked.
